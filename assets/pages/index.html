									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p> I am a researcher and administrator, currently employed as the research coordinator at <a href="https://www.belgiumcampus.ac.za/">Belgium Campus iTversity</a></p>

								<details>
									<summary>I have more than 20 years of experience spanning engineering, software development and academia in the South African context ... </summary>
									<p>
										... where I have worked for a variety of companies, from research institutions, startups and corporate software giants to my current academic focus where I now serve as research coordinator at Belgium Campus iTversity. I am an associate of the National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Science, and also a council member of the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Professional Working Committee of the International Alliance of Skills Development. I serve on the BRICS South African Skills Development, Applied Technology and Innovation Working Group national committee where I am the lead expert in the standards development stream. As part of this work, I helped to draft two international BRICS standards, one on Machine Learning and Big Data, and a second on Data Analysis and Visualisation as part of the international team of experts. I have also recently been elected to the South African Bureau of Standards SABS/TC0001/SC42 technical Committee on Artificial Intelligence. <br />

									The bulk of my research has been in the realms of engineering and science education, serious games and computer science. In my MTech research I focussed on test fixtures for high volume manufacturing and developed a reliability-based model for the selection of test probe receptacles, and in my Phd I focussed on capstone project modules in engineering education and how they can be enriched through gameful design, gamification and a focus on self-determination theory with authentic learning. In my current research I explore the applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning as well as computer science education.<br />
									
									In terms of teaching I have taught Artificial Intelligence at the 3rd year and Honours level as well as programming in the first year. I have experience supervising at the masters and PhD level and have delivered four MSc students, two MEng students and one PhD student so far in my career. I have co-authored fourteen journal articles and equivalents as well as eighteen peer-reviewed conference articles so far in my career.
