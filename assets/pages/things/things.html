									<h2>Things I have worked on</h2>								
								</header>
								<p>This is a non-exhaustive list of projects I have worked on during the course of my career. I am still working on bringing in all the information from the different projects, so this page will be a work in progress for a while still - watch this space!</p>
								<details>
									<summary>In my career I have gone through three distinct phases ... </summary>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>2017 - current: Research and Academia. After my time in the software space, I moved into academia, which is where I still find myself. I have spent time focussing on electronic engineering where I have supervised a number of postgraduate students and spent my PhD working on engineering education, but I have also spent significant time in computer science where I have taught artificial intelligence for many years, supervised postgraduate students, and held leadership roles at both North-West University and Belgium Campus. My research has been in a variety of fields, but my main focus is technology education and serious games.</li>
											<li>2014 - 2017: Enterprise Software Development. I spent about two and a half years working on enterprise software at Britehouse, a division of Dimension Data. I spent extensive time working on custom developed software, as well as working on SharePoint and CRM, both on premise and in the cloud.</li>
											<li>2001 - 2014: Hardware and Electronic Engineering. I spent time working in electronics and telecommunications for the first four years of my career at the National Research Foundation, and then spent the next eight years in electronic and embedded engineering roles in a number of startup companies. I focussed a lot on electronic design, PCB layout, manufacturing and embedded development during this time.</li>
										</ul>
										On this page I will highlight the projects that I have worked on in my career and give an overview of the work, as well as reflecting on what I learned during each project.
