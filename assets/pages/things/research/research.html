								<h2>Research Projects</h2>
							</header>				
							<p>I have spent many years working on a variety of research projects, predominantly in Serious Games and Technology Education, but also touching on Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Electronic Engineering. </p>

												<p>
													This was the backbone system that I used extensively during my PhD. It was a gamified system with a number of sub-systems which are documented on other pages that guided the students through their final year capstone projects in Electronic Engineering.

												<p>
													As part of my PhD, while gamifying the capstone projects module, I also developed a system for the implementation of Location Based Games which was used at the University of Johannesburg, and afterwards at a number of conferences.

												<p>
													To gamify the process of project allocations while also creating a more fair and transparent system I developed the Tender Game over a number of iterations, and made heavy use of the Stable Marriage Algorithm including indifference.

												<p>
													To further drive engagement and introduce additional learnign opportunities during the course of the year, and to support the other gamified systems, I created a Challenge-based system that was inspired by the Superbetter approach that was popularised by Jane McGonigal.
