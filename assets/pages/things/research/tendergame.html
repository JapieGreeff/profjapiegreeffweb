									<p>As part of my doctoral studies, I developed a gamification based system that comprised of a number of gamefully designed components. Here I describe one of the gamified interventions that formed part of the project, the Tender game.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In my capacity as researcher working with the course coordinator at the University of Johannesburg, I embarked on a journey in 2016 to fundamentally transform the way the Electrical Engineering students engage with their final-year capstone projects. The capstone project is the summit of an undergraduate engineering degree, serving as a summative assessment of a student's knowledge gained over four years of rigorous study. However, for many years, the process of assigning these projects at UJ was fraught with administrative friction, a lack of transparency, and a palpable sense of student dissatisfaction. 
                                        I realized that for students to truly excel, they needed to be intrinsically motivated, and this motivation could only be cultivated if they felt a sense of autonomy and ownership over their chosen topics.
                                        This realisation led to the conceptualisation of the Tender Game, a serious educational game designed to gamify the project selection and assignment process. My goal was not merely to automate a manual task but to create an authentic learning environment where students could navigate a system mirroring the professional engineering landscape in South Africa.

                                    <h4>Genesis of the Tender Game</h4>
									<p>During an assessment of students' experience of the manner in which the course was presented, the following problems were identified:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A lack of input by students during project allocations</li>
                                            <li>A lack of transparency on the assignment mechanism</li>
                                            <li>Sub-optimal assignments due to a manual process (sub-optimal assignments were seen as allocations where both the student and study leader were unhappy with the assignment)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <p>The process referenced above took place as follows:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Study leaders proposed projects they wished to offer in the following academic year</li>
                                            <li>Students received the proposed projects on the learning management system</li>
                                            <li>Students indicated on a Facebook group which projects they were interested in</li>
                                            <li>The course coordinator assigned projects manually to students taking into account their preferences and any other available information.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    <p>While projects were not assigned randomly, the process was time intensive and manaul, and many people were unhappy with it, and on top of the administrative burden it was clear the process was a barrier to engagement.</p>

                                    <h4>Theoretical Foundations</h4>
									<p>The design of the Tender Game was anchored in several key theoretical frameworks:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Self-Determination Theory (SDT): Through the work of Ryan and Deci it was determined that for students to feel intrinsic motivation to complete a task as complex as a capstone project they needed to feel that their choice matters (Autonomy), that they are part of a greater community that shares their experience (Relatedness/Community), and that they are successfully mastering challenges (Competence/Mastery).</li>
                                        <li>Authentic Learning: I grounded the capstone journey in the principles of authentic learning, where learning is rooted in real-world problems and discourse among learners. I followed the guidance of Herrington, who suggests that online spaces can be authentic if they simulate real-life activities and provide access to expert performance. By framing project selection as a "tender" process, I allowed students to fill multiple roles and perspectives similar to what they would encounter in the South African engineering industry.</li>
                                        <li>Bloom's Affective Domain and Gradients of Abstraction: While engineering is often viewed through the cognitive domain, I focused on the affective domain to explore the internalisation of professional values. I utilized Floridi's concept of Gradients of Abstraction rather than discrete levels to reflect that the transition from "Receiving" information to "Characterising" it (acting according to internalised values) is non-linear and complex. As students experienced more cognitive and emotional load, I recognized that more complex interventions were required.</li>
                                        <li>Gameful Design Theory: As will be seen, there are differences between Gameful Design, Gamification, Serious Games, Simulations, etc. that create different categories of interventions which ended up being a very interesting area of the literature to dive into. I will focus here more on the Gamification aspect, but in my full thesis there is an extensive literature review of the different areas. </li>

                                        <li>Project Presentation: Projects were presented grouped by study area.</li>
                                        <li>Tender Submission: Students had two weeks to write a 2-3 page tender for each project they were interested in, proposing how they would solve the problem.</li>
                                        <li>Anonymisation: To ensure fairness, tenders were anonymized before the voting stage.</li>
                                        <li>Voting: Both students and faculty voted on which tenders were most applicable to the problems.</li>
                                        <li>Scoring: Votes were tallied to assign a preference score to each tender.</li>
                                        <li>Matching: The Gale-Shapley algorithm was run to assign students to projects.</li>

This means that because there are fewer study leaders than students, each individual studyleader's vote counts more, but all the votes of the study leaders summed together count the same as all the students summed together.

                                        <h4>Matching and Stable Marriage Problems</h4>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="../../../../images/stableMarriageAlgorithm.png" alt="" /></a>	
											<div class="inner">
												<p>
													To solve the problem of matching students to projects in a way that was both fair and optimal, I turned to the stable marriage problem and the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The goal was to find a stable matching between two sets of equal size (Students and Projects) based on their mutual preferences.
                                                    A matching is deemed stable when there are no two pairs <i>(s, p)</i> such that the student <i>s</i> and the project preference for <i>p</i> would both prefer to be matched with each other over their current matches. The Gale-Shapley algorithm provides an iterative path to this stability. I implemented the algorithm using students as the "suitors" or "proposers" and projects as the "reviewers". This creates a student-optimal stable matching, ensuring that each student is matched with the most preferred project they could possibly obtain in any stable matching.                                                                                                   </p>

									<p>The algorithm developed for the Tender Game proceeds as follows:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Initialisation: All students <i>s</i> and projects <i>p</i> are initially unmatched.</li>
                                            <li>Proposals: Each unmatched student <i>S[i]</i> "proposes" to the project <i>p</i>they prefer most in their preference list <i>PS</i>.</li>
                                            <li>Provisional Acceptance: Each project <i>p</i> provisionally accepts the student if they are more suitable than their current match based on the project's preference list <i>PP</i>, and declines all others.</li>
                                            <li>Iteration: In each subsequent matching iteration round, unmatched students propose to their next highest-ranked project. If a project receives a proposal from a student it prefers over its current engagement, it "breaks" the current engagement to accept the new student.</li>
                                            <li>Termination: The process continues until all students and projects are matched.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    <p>
                                        In a real-world educational setting, students and project leaders do not always have a fully ordered list of every possible option. I used Irving's modification to the Gale-Shapley algorithm to incorporate the concept of indifference. Indifference occurs when a player is confronted with two options that are equally suitable or unsuitable. In my implementation, I focused on "weakly stable" matchings, where there are no two couples that strictly prefer each other's partners. This approach maintained a runtime complexity of <i>O(n&sup2)</i>, which was sufficient for our class sizes.

                                                    In the 2017 field trial, 89 students participated. Eight students opted to propose their own unique projects, which were accepted by the faculty and assigned directly. This represented a 91% adoption rate of the gamified process. It was however found that 19 of the projects had zero tenders, meaning that no students were interested in those projects. One of the most interesting findings was the "solar rush". Projects related to renewable energy, such as the "Automatic solar street light controller" and "Energy optimisation with smart solar panels," received a disproportionately high number of tenders at 21 and 12 respectively. Meanwhile, 19 projects received no interest at all. This imbalance meant that the "indifference" in the matching was quite high.

As my simulation had predicted, the average number of tenders per student (2.67) was below the threshold of 4.8 required for a clean match for the entire cohort. The performance would still however have ended up with some students getting a project they were indifferent to, since 19 projects had no interest. To ensure all students were assigned, I conducted a second round where unmatched students could choose from remaining projects without writing a new tender. Additionally some popular projects' study leaders agreed to duplicate their projects to accommodate more students. After this repeat, only 12 students remained unmatched, so they could be dealt with manually.

									<p>
                                        Following the 2017 iteration, I held collaborative design sessions with the students to gather feedback. A major point of contention was the "social" aspect of the game. Some students felt that the voting process was being "gamed" by popular students who lobbied their friends to vote for their tenders, a phenomenon I termed "social cheating". Students expressed that they didn't want the social pressure to be "popular" to influence their project allocation. This was a critical insight for me; while I wanted a sociable game, I realised that for high-stakes decisions like capstone projects, students preferred technical merit to prevail over populism.

                                    <h4>Evolution to the Final Prototype</h4>
									<p>
                                        Based on the feedback from 2017, I fundamentally pivoted the mechanics of the Tender Game for the 2018 academic year. I moved away from a system where students were allocated to pre-defined projects and instead moved toward a competitive, internship-style application process. This time there would be a focus on new mechanics and a portfolio approach. The 2018 version was therefor almost an inversion of the 2017 system with the following characterstics:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Leader Profiles: Study leaders created profile pages detailing their expertise and past projects.</li>
                                        <li>Student Proposals: Students had two weeks to write a project proposal that they would submit to their chosen leaders, explaining why they wanted to work with them personally.</li>
                                        <li>The Challenge System: To support their applications, students used a parallel "Challenge System" to build a portfolio of work and overcome small developmental tasks set by study leaders that would indicate what they looked for in a student.</li>
                                        <li>Competitive Selection: Study leaders then ranked the students who applied to them. Each leader had eight slots available, which automatically increased the number of data points for the matching algorithm to ensure stability.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                   <p>
                                        I also introduced what I termed the "Black Ball" or decline mechanic to increase faculty autonomy. Unlike indifference, where a study leader simply didn't care which student they got, the "Black Ball" allowed a studyleader to remove a student from their pool if they felt the student was technically or mathematically unprepared for the work they trialed in the challenges. This triggered an intervention where the student was given a week to address the study leader's concerns, often with the help of the university's writing center, and then attempt the application again in the next round. In the image below you can see a study leader that has eigth students that have already been assigned to them, along with an application that has been declined from a prospective student.

                                                    The matching system was run in three primary iterations, with results showing a very high level of student satisfaction with their placements. 
                                                    The 12 students who remained after the third iteration were those who had consistently failed to meet the requirements set by the study leaders, often by submitting minimal or no work repeatedly. Because the vast majority of the class had been automatically and satisfactorily allocated, we were able to dedicate time to providing these specific students with the individual attention and support they needed to reach the right level with select study leaders. Early intervention this way lead to much better results through the course of the year as were found with interviews with the course coordinator and study leaders.

                                        <a href="#" class="image"><img src="../../../../images/IMITenderGame2018n19.png" alt="" /></a>

                                            To measure more quantitatively whether students found the process enjoyable and effective, a general questionaire was set up and given to students along with semi-structured interviews to see whether they found gamification effective in this setting. Additionally, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory was given to the same students to determine what sort of intrinsic motivation they experienced in using the system. This was a voluntary interview and questionaire, and 19 out of the 138 students that were registered at the start of the year took part. As some students also dropped out of the course, this represented just over 14% of the students in the class. The results weve very positive with students on average and on median indicating positive experiences of the gamification, and in the IMI, all the scales tended towards the positive direction, with the average scores for elements being:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Interest/Enjoyment: Average 70%, Median 65%</li>
                                                <li>Perceived Competence: Average 65%, Median 69%</li>
                                                <li>Perceived Choice: Average 59%, Median 61%</li>
                                                <li>Pressure/Tension: Average 65%, 67%</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            The Pressure/Tension measurement in the IMI was high, but through discussion we concluded that due to the nature of the project allocations that students were going through, it would be difficult to remove the pressure that students experienced no matter how much gamification is implemented, as this is a large component of their degrees and has a direct impact on their futures.

                                    <h4>Qualitative Insights</h4>
									<p>
                                        Some insights obtained from the students and faculty members that stood out were:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Throughout the implementation, I gathered extensive qualitative feedback from the students and study leaders. One of the most fascinating phenomena I observed was "buyer's remorse". By giving students the autonomy to propose their own projects, we also gave them the "freedom to fail".</li>
                                            <li>Some students, in their enthusiasm to choose their own path, pitched projects that were beyond their current technical capabilities. One student reflected <i>"I really had no idea what I was signing up for, and I regret my choice. I would have really appreciated project ideas from my project leader... Honestly feel like I am in this alone"</i>. This highlighted a fundamental challenge in balancing autonomy with feasibility. While I viewed the fact that students took on tough projects as a positive, reflecting that those who deliberately pitched tough projects got the maximum value, it also created a disparity in the student experience. Some students felt it was unfair that their chosen projects were more difficult than those of their peers. Although the projects weren't all equally challenging, all of them were deemed at a suitable level by the study leaders who did have experience in these matters.</li>
                                            <li>I identified a disconnect between student expectations and faculty perspectives regarding supervision. Students consistently requested more active supervision, while study leaders felt that, by the fourth year, students should be able to work more independently. I realised that the Challenge System was the best way to bridge this gap. By providing students with a bank of challenges to upskill themselves, we could provide the necessary guidance without placing an unsustainable administrative burden on the faculty.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Additionally, some of my own philosophical reflections that I could highlight were:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Autonomy is not a universal good. While I remain a firm believer in the power of autonomy, I did learn that it must be scaffolded. Giving students complete freedom without the experience to judge feasibility could lead to frustration and isolation.</li>
                                            <li>The importance of "Gameful" rather than "Gamer" design. I discovered that the social pressure of being "popular" was a negative side effect of my initial design. Students in a high-stress degree like engineering do not always want more social pressure. By pivoting to a less gamified version in 2018 with fewer social voting elements and a greater focus on competitive application I achieved a more favorable result. This taught me that game elements should only be used where they directly support the pedagogical goals, and that less is often more when it comes to gamification in higher education.</li>
                                            <li>Scalability and administrative relief is valuable. One of the immediate successes of the Tender Game was the reduction in the administrative burden for the course coordinator. Even with a lower level of tenders per student, the automated matching provided a stable and idealised baseline that I could then refine. This allows for the scaling of capstone project courses to much larger student cohorts without a linear increase in management time.</li>
                                        </ul>
