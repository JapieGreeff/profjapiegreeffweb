									<h2>Developing a Reliability Based Model for Selecting Test Probe Receptacle Interfaces</h2>									
								</header>				
                                <p>During my master's degree I developed a system that allowed me to do reliability tests of a variety of high volume manufacturing test probe receptacle interfaces by developing a custom environmental stress chamber and a custom test system to run it and collect data.</p>
