									<h2>Util Labs Generic Test Jig Framework</h2>

                                <p>While working at Util Labs I was also studying part time towards my BTech degree. As I was in charge of the electronic engineering component of the test fixtures for our high speed manufacturing line, I used the generic test fixture system that I had designed as the basis for my 4th year project. I won the SAIEE National Student Project Awards 1st place award for this project.</p>
