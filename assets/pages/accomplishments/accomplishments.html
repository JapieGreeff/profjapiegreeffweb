												<h4>South African Institute of Electrical Engineers Student Project Awards 2011 - First Prize</h4>
												<p>When I finished my Bachelors in Technology degree, I was elected to represent my university, Tshwane University of Technology, at the annual South African Institute of Electrical Engineers Student Project Awards Competition. My final year project was based on novel work I was doing in industry to create generic test fixtures that could be used during the manufacturing process to test different kinds of products by swapping out the front end of the fixture that comprises of the spring loaded connection pins with different front ends that were made from circuit boards as strength members and generic back end. This was work that I continued on with in my Masters degree where I was also focused on high volume manufacturing. </p>
